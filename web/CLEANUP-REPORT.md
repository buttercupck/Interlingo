# Codebase Cleanup Report - February 1, 2026

## Philosophy

This cleanup follows the principle: **"Does this file spark joy in production?"**

A clean, organized codebase makes developers happy and productive. Every file should have a clear home, and everything that doesn't serve the current production system should be thanked for its service and archived for reference.

## What Was Done

### Files Archived

All archived files have been moved to the `_archive/` directory, organized by purpose:

#### Design References → `_archive/design-references/`
- **card-comparison-guide.html** - Visual comparison guide between production and mockup card styling
- **phase1-color-reference.html** - Phase 1 CSS consolidation and color reference guide

**Why archived:** These were HTML-based design comparison tools used during initial development. The design system is now stable and documented in `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`. These files served their purpose beautifully during the design phase but are no longer needed in the root directory.

#### POC Documentation → `_archive/poc-docs/`
- **PHASE1-PROOF-OF-CONCEPT.md** - Detailed documentation of the single-source-of-truth configuration system proof of concept

**Why archived:** This POC was successful and the feature is now integrated into production. The documentation is valuable for understanding the evolution of the system, but it's historical context rather than active development documentation.

**Key Achievement Documented:** Dynamic organization-specific instructions managed through database config instead of hardcoded logic.

#### Debug Notes → `_archive/debug-notes/`
- **DEBUG.md** - TypeScript type system issues and temporary debugging notes

**Why archived:** These were point-in-time debugging notes documenting Supabase type generation issues. While useful for reference, they represent temporary challenges during development rather than ongoing production concerns.

### Files Deleted

- **tsconfig.tsbuildinfo** - TypeScript build cache artifact

**Why deleted:** This file is automatically regenerated by the TypeScript compiler on every build. It's a build artifact that should not be committed to version control and serves no purpose in the repository.

## What Was Preserved

All production-critical files remain in their original locations:

### Application Code
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/components` - React components
- `/lib` - Utility libraries and services
- `/scripts` - Build and utility scripts

### Configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Package dependencies
- `bun.lock` - Bun lockfile
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (gitignored)
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude AI interaction guidelines
- `middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware
- `run-migration.ts` - Database migration runner

### Current State
- `.next/` - Next.js build output (gitignored)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (gitignored)

## Archive Structure

```
_archive/
├── design-references/
│   ├── card-comparison-guide.html
│   └── phase1-color-reference.html
├── poc-docs/
│   └── PHASE1-PROOF-OF-CONCEPT.md
└── debug-notes/
    └── DEBUG.md
```

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Clearer Root Directory** - Easier to find active production files
2. **Preserved History** - Old files are archived, not deleted, for future reference
3. **Better Organization** - Related archived files are grouped together
4. **Reduced Confusion** - Developers won't wonder if POC files are still relevant
5. **Faster Onboarding** - New developers see only current, active files

## How to Find Archived Files

If you need to reference archived files:
- Design references: `_archive/design-references/`
- POC documentation: `_archive/poc-docs/`
- Debug notes: `_archive/debug-notes/`

## Notes

- The `.next/` directory and build artifacts continue to be gitignored per `.gitignore`
- No production code or configuration was modified during this cleanup
- All moves were file relocations; no content was changed
- The `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` file will regenerate automatically on next build

## Post-Cleanup Checklist

- [x] Created `_archive/` directory structure
- [x] Moved HTML design references
- [x] Moved POC documentation
- [x] Moved debug notes
- [x] Removed build artifacts
- [x] Created this cleanup report
- [ ] Verify development server still runs correctly
- [ ] Update .gitignore if needed to exclude tsconfig.tsbuildinfo

## Thank You

Thank you to all the archived files for their service during development. You helped us build a better system, and you'll always be available in the archive when we need to look back.
